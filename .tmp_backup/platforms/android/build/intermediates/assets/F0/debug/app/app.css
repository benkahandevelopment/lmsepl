/*
In NativeScript, the app.css file is where you place CSS rules that
you would like to apply to your entire application. Check out
http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/styling for a full list of the CSS
selectors and properties you can use to style UI components.

/*
For example, the following CSS rule changes the font size of all UI
components that have the btn class name.
*/

Page {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    border: none;
}

.btn {
    font-size: 18;
}

.boldFont {
    font-family: "Gravity-Bold";
    text-transform: uppercase;
}

/*
In many cases you may want to use the NativeScript core theme instead
of writing your own CSS rules. For a full list of class names in the theme
refer to http://docs.nativescript.org/ui/theme.

@import 'nativescript-theme-core/css/core.light.css';
